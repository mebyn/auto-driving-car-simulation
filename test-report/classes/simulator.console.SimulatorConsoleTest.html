<pre>Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!

Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format: You have created a field of 10 x 10

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Your input: 
Please enter the name of the car: Please enter initial position of car A in x y Direction format: Please enter the commands for car A: 
Your current list of cars are: 
- A, (1, 2), N, FFRFFFFRRL

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Your input: 
Your current list of cars are: 
- A, (1, 2), N, FFRFFFFRRL

After simulation, the result is:
- A, (5, 4), S
